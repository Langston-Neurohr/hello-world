1.Why do video games offer more satisfaction than other forms of art?

2.Does more interactivity and control lead to more satisfaction?

3.Do people prefer playing more realistic games that they can identify with?

Does more interactivity and control lead to more satisfaction? (although this bleeds into question 1 a bit)

I believe the video game industry and market is increasing and doing so well because of the rise of interactive technology and content that is being distributed. As technology is developed even further and with the release of the next generation of gaming consoles, the amount of connection the player has with the game and its interaction with it creates a much more entrenched and deeper experience with the video game. Video games with story choices and different outcomes show how different types of players can react and play the game, or it adds to the replay value. Although story driven choices and outcomes are particulary linear and rarely complex, they still add to the value and interaction with the game.

In contrast to other forms of art and storytelling, mediums such as cinema, theater, or books can accomplish interaction, but choose your own adventure books, and interactive movies like the Black Mirror one don't have the tools to accomplish such deep and personal player interaction. Many video games such as Red Dead Redemption show how they can use the players choices to manipulate the outcome, but not just the linear choices they have to make, but  how the player behaves in the open world has consequences, and affects how NPC's will react to the player as well as other things.

The small interactions in games add just as much as the larger more drastic interactions, often found at the end of video games. The enjoyability from video games comes from the experience the player has, and having personalized interaction with the way you behave in the world adds greatly to the satisfaction and your involvement. Games like Dishonered or RDR, have much more satisfaction because everything you do has consequences, committing crimes or killing more people will affect the outcome of the game, as well as the overall feel and environment when in the world.
