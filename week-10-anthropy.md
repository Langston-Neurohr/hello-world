Accessibility to gaming and coding would help improve video games by allowing for videogames to be creates by people from several different backgrounds and perspectives. With more cultures and groups of people with access to video games and the tools for creating them, more people from background other than the usual, white college-educated male to be involved in the process of developing video games. The tools for creating video games being easily available on the internet to use or learn allow for anyone with computer access at least, to pursue video game development and even become proficient in it. The author Anna states that videos games often only hold the values of the developers, and adding more values widens the audience who will enjoy the game.
Not only could it help larger scale video games reach a wider audience and have more genuine and identifiable people, but it also allows for the people with the tools available to them to use or learn to create their own video games. Many of the video games on twine are created by people with little to no experience in game development, but it stills allows them to create a video game that they can identify with, and possibly other people from their culture can as well. 
The benefit of more voices in the process of creation of video games allows for different identities and characters to be portrayed correctely. When games are most often largely created by white men, as Anna Anthropy says, it leads to often one portrayal or perception of characters the developers don't identify with, which can lead to misrepresentation. Adding more voices in the creation process benefits the company as well, with more representation and people to identify with, as well as people from different groups and cultures colloborating creates content more genuine and isn't likely to be seen as "taboo". This opens up the games audience to a much wider audience.
Every form of art that involves a group of people collaborating shouldn't contain just one sole perspective, whether cinema, theater, or videogames. As stated by Anna, "creations of art shouldn't come from and contain exactly one perspective", and they all benefit it terms of genuine connection to a more diverse audience if more cultures are included in the creation process.
