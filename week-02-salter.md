One of the strongest examples of a Gesamtkunstwerk in a contemparary setting is architecture. When architecture is used as a art form, you literally become fully immersed in the work of art. Mixing architecure with interior design and painting or sculptured create a space that is entirely a combination of different art forms. 18th century opera houses and even modern ones show how architecture can be used and change your experience with other forms of art.

Digitally one of the strongest ways to create a Gesamtkunstwerk is through film, many works of digital art that are stills will have a hard time synthesizing as many art forms or immerse their audience. Film however, you can become easily immersed regardless of what is going on around you. Film easily combines history, technology, music, social commentary, and hundreds of other forms of art. One of my favorite examples of Gesamtkunstwerk in film is Disney's 2000 _Fantasia_, which uses music and animation and collaborates between the two to tell stories.

Video games have substantial potential for creating a  digital Gesamtkunstwerk, although there aren't as many examples of this as an combination of art forms, they have potential to be one of the best platforms for a Gesamtkunstwerk. Theoretically, any form of art, ranging from music to architecture, even to engineering and social commentary can be applied in a video game, in addition to audience participation and decision making.
