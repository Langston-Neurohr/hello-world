In 1997, Janet Murray makes succesful claims on what the future of what digital television will entail. She foresees the emergence of the internet becoming a large system of broadcast where content is accesible in much greater quantities. Examples of the interactive narratives and inhabitable virtual environments that Murray predicts are abundant on digital platforms nowadays, the Black Mirror interactive movie or the expanding list of open world videogames show this to be true.
Video games are largely made up of the predictions Janet Murray had about them over twenty years ago, they offer interactive experiences with stories we may be familar with or not. The addition of our own decision making when it comes to stories adds to the audiences experience, this role playing in virtual environments adds to our enjoyment and satisfaction granted, when we see the results of our own decisions.

The virtual environments of The Mandolorian are examples of how it can be achieved on high levels to create perfect digital environments. The hyper-realistic and easily manipulatable environments they are able to create adds to the level of immersion and enjoyment for the viewer.For the actors, their reality of the environment is foreseeable, with green screens actors do not see their environment until post production, but the addition of the virtual sets adds to the actors reality, where instead of just portraying the role, they are placed into a live setting that allows for them to see their own reality, and the reality of the sets works with the actor to create realistic virtual lighting and visual effects. While the audience sees the same environment of the actor, they see it from one angle which allows for the immersions and plausibility of the shows. For the viewer, the virtual environment is the reality of what they see on the screen, while the actors work under the additional layer of production, where they can also see and be apart of the tools of production that create the high levels of immersion for the viewer.
