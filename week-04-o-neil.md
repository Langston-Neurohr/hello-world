An WMD, or a Weapon of Math Destruction as O'neil calls it, is a system or algorithm that has a societal impact, which often are used in ways that reinforce prexisting inequalities and further them. Examples of them exist in everyday society and more likely than not, we've all been apart of one whether we were aware of it or not. Weapons of Math Destruction often run with historical data and definition of success, but these algorithms often cause damage to those with exceptions. Exampes pertinent in society could be included as job applications and evaluations, often on. the lower end of the economy.
As stated by O'neil, the masses are more often evaluated by machines, and the affluent are often evaulated by other people, which makes up room for error. An WMD could be job applications that require prior work experience necessary, students graduating college can struggle finding work in their field because they need related job experience, but becuase of the situations of their schooling certain students might not be able to het the job. In this case, the WMD further pushes the inequalities, because someone who already has experience in the field will likely get the job, while the people who need work experience in the field will be penalized for not having the same prior oppurtunities, and will further be inequalized against.   
Because this WMD doesn't allow for those without prior experience to be applicants, it continues to reinforce the notion that those without experience aren't as skilled or "good". But in reality those who don't have experience in the field can be just as good, but they aren't evaluated that way. As it takes them longer to find a job where they get experience in the field, the further the inequalities are pushed. THE WMD's become detrimental to originally finding experience, because it values those with previous experience of those who don't, which can often lead to a few of those with experience to more oppurtunities, while still punishing those without experience when they didn't have the same prior oppurtunities.
