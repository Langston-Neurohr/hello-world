When consuming internet media and using the tools available on it im subject to data collection for targeted ads. When on instagram of facebook, i'll often get ads for restaurants that I have recently googled, which is just one example of recieving targeted ads. The design of the content I view will effect my interaction with it as well, similar to the ideas presented by Gayomali, I will be much more likely to distrust an article or or opinion when presented in a unprofessional manner. Gayomali talks about the effects of fonts when used for different purposes, when it comes to the use of different fonts it depends on what material you're reading, if it's for entertainment or for fun then comic sans would be applicable, but if you are reading to become more informed or for school purposes, it should be presented in a professional manner and that includes the use of fonts that that are more structered. 

When it comes to the effects this has on the media as a whole, I think targeted ads and data collection can mostly be harmless and even beneficial. The use of different design for different audience and intention also serves a purpose and is often beneficial to your time on the internet. Targeted ads based off data collection seems like a slight breach of privacy, but in most cases the ads they present are likely something you want and are usually harmless acts of collecting your data. The benefits is getting ads for things you would enjoy, and likely not seeing ads for things you don't like. There are downsides to targeted ads represented largely in politics. For example, Facebook ads would target left or right wing individuals, and push them ads and information that may not be entirely factual, and can effect the trust of the people in government as well as their own beleifs.

When it comes to trusting something online a lot of the blind faith will come from the design of the information or argument. It helps differentiate between topics that are professionaly thought about and topics that are insignificant and nonessential, but similar to targeted ads there is downsides to the effect of this on media. Circling back to politics, many of the ads or information that is feeded to you online makes uses of a professional and significant design element, which makes the information more believable regardless of the merit it holds, simpy because it looks important or made by a professional.
