The saying from Lev Manovich that "interactive media ask us to identify with someone elseâ€™s mental structure" is understood by me as when it comes to interactive mediea, it is only interactive to a certain extent and we still follow the authority of the creator, which is the mental structure of the media. Apps and websites that are interactive greatly very in purpose and are used for different things, Apps like gmail differ because they are used as tools of private communication, and likely reflect the developers desire for good communication, and something like facebook is to share your experiences publicy.

Snapchat, which I most frequently use, reflects the developers identity in the way it wants to share experiences and and socialize on a deeper level than messaging. The developers likely believed that socialization and the sharing of your experiences are help connect to people through media, who you may not be able to interact with as much. Snapchat allows for a deeper level of messaging because it includes a picture that is often your face, which is a tool for more meaning to be received and is more interactive. It's a reflection of their own identity and mental structures because they created a more interactive and deeper way to talk to people and share the things you are doing in the moment, which is something they likely felt lacked from other social medias and in turn Snapchat became a reflection of their ideals.
