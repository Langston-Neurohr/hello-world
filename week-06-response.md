In his article for the Medium, James Bridle presents the idea that the internet can be unsafe for children and their psychological development even. He lays out the problem, which is that innopropiate content and potentially violent or sexual content is being permitted and exposed to children on the interet. The problem is completely valid and true in most contexts, as someone who also grew up on the internet along with my sibling and friends, I've been witness to the type of content that can find itself available to the youth, and even though there is an attempt to filter this content, it seemingly is still shown to kids on almost every website with user uploaded content.
I agree that this type of content can frighten or traumatize children, and it has no place on the internet where children can easily or accidentally stumble onto it. Bridle, along with myself, beleives that the internet and services that have content uploaded for children should be heavily filtered and decontaminated. Content showing violence or sexual activities to children directly affects their thinking and development of whats deemed "okay" by society. Algorithms on the internet can become a tool of abuse when left unchecked, combinations of words or phrases, or even photos become randomly generated and mixed, sometimes leading to computer generated content becomeing inappropriate. Becoming exposed to inappropriate content from a young age can cause a child to become more inclined to find "dark humor" funny
